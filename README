Geo::Coordinates::OSGB
Geo::Coordinates::OSTN02
----------------------

Routines to convert latitude and longitude coordinates to and from
transverse Mercator grid references, that are optimized for use with the
British national grid.

The OSGB module provides routines to convert between latitude/longitude
coordinates based on the British Ordnance Survey's standard geoid model
(Airy 1830) and the British National Grid.  The module includes some
useful extra routines to parse and format grid references in a variety
of popular forms (including which Landranger map your point appears on).

The second module provides an implementation of the newly released
transformation tables that are now used by the British Ordnance Survey
to define the National Grid from GPS surveys.  This module provides
accurate conversion between the British National Grid and
latitude/longitude coordinates based on the global WGS84 geoid model
(the one used by all GPS devices, and popular mapping tools such as
Google Earth).  The OSTN02 data is rather large (11M bytes), and will
take a couple of seconds to load even on a quick machine, but once
loaded conversions should be reasonably quick.

INSTALLATION

This package installs in the regular Perl way.  You don't need the C
compiler and as far as I know there are no platform dependencies.
Either use your local package tool, or "perl -MCPAN -e shell".  Can also
be installed by hand; just unzip it to some temporary home, then do the
usual thing:

        Perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

DEPENDENCIES

None
