Revision history for Perl extension Geo::Coordinates::OSGB

2.04  6 November 2008

    - Rework search of OSTN02 data to improve performance and reliability
    - Add range checking of OSTN02 coordinates
    - Compress OSTN02 data to hexadecimal form to speed up loading
    - Change selection of data in 03random.t test to avoid off-the-sheet errors
    - Minor tidy up changes in OSGB
    - Complete overhaul of the documentation
    - removed old "coco.pl" example script
    - added new example script to show all "000 000" grid references

2.03 Not released

2.02 22 September 2008

    - Removed irritating degree sign from verbose test message (no functional change)
    - Make parse_landranger_grid behave better in scalar context
    - Improve useability of parse_grid
    - Correct GR of SW corner of Landranger Sheet 3
    - Further optimize handling of OSTN02 data to prevent data parsing at pod2man time
    - Improve documentation
    - More example scripts (with notes)

2.01 6 September 2007

    - Optimized handling of OSTN02 data to reduce memory requirements *and* speed it up.

2.00 4 September 2007

    - New version with routines to do adjustment to and from latitude and
      longitude coordinates based on the (now ubiquitous) WGS84 model, for
      more compatible use with GPS receivers and Google Earth and similar
      tools.

    - Includes not only fast approximate adjustment as used in most
      coordinate tools and devices, but also the definitive-but-slow OSTN02
      transformation based on OSGB data

    - Step version number

    - POD completely revised


1.07 7 September 2005

       - corrected link in POD

       - various minor documentation corrections

1.06 16 May 2005

       - general clean up

       - made the format and parse routines external to avoid spaghetti connections

       - added support for grid references in GPS format (eg TQ 32342 24312)

1.05 29 March 2005

       - Not released

1.04  29 September 2004

        - corrected a bug in grid2ll, where long/lat values with 0 degrees
          were always printed as positive in scalar form The problem was that
          -1 * 0 = +0 in Perl (as it says in the Camel book somewhere).

        - added simple coco.pl script to provide command line coordinate
          conversions.

        - actually implemented the long-promised map2ll and ll2map functions
          as well as map2grid and grid2map for completeness.  With these
          functions you can convert to and from coordinates in a more useable
          form, such as "OS Sheet 43; 875123".

        - added a demonstration script --- plotmaps.pl --- which will produce
          a pretty index of the Landranger maps, showing the GB coast line
          and the large grid squares.  The output is in PostScript.  Use
          GhostScript to process it.  A PDF version of the output is also
          included.

        - added a useful file with all the names and other details of the
          Landranger Sheets

1.03  18 December 2002
        - changed name for CPAN release
        - improved ll2grid function
        - new ll2map and map2ll functions


1.02  November 13, 2002
        - No changes to code, just tidied the documentation

0.01  Fri Mar  2 19:05:50 2001
